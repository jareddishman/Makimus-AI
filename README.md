# 🦉 Makimus-AI - AI Image Search

Search your entire image library using **natural language or an image** — just type what you're looking for or drop an image, and Makimus-AI finds visually similar results instantly using AI.

> Example: type *"Girl wearing a red armor"* or *"dog playing in grass"* — or just **Use an image** to find visually similar ones from your folders.
